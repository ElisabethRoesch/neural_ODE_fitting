Thank you for your wonderful talk, jesse.

I'm very happy to be here today. Thanks to organizers for managing the conference and having me.
Thanks to you guys for listen to my talk.

I'm Elisabeth. I'm a PhD student with Michael Stumpf, Uni Melbs.
I was at JuliaCon last year, as participant.
I feel honored to be able to talk this year about some work I have done in collaboration with Chis.

I'll also talk about neural ODEs and the package DiffEqFlux.
But from a different perspective.

I'm a bioinformatitian by training. Working now more in Theoretical systems biology.
I want to first start by showing you my view on neural ODEs and my motivation of why I use them in my research.


____


One huge area in theo sys bio are: dynamical systems . often no linear relationship between time and species I am interested in.

Example: protein over time , your heart rate over time, planton in a lake -> fiugre


Model this nonlinearity: there are three main approaches that i could take. -> figure

In my field: interpretability very important. so pure ML models are often not sufficient for our kind of problems.
But also often we do not have enough prior knowledge, e.g. stucture of systems still unknown.

And this is where neural ODEs come in

ODE - substitute unknown f (=dudt) with neural net -> neural ODE <3

so for me: prediction of neural net for start condition u0 -> relates to solving ode


To make it very clear again: I use neural ODEs where I actually want to use a DiffEq but I do not have the prior knowledge.

____

Training neural net:


Standard L2. problem if much data, ode solver precise, it can get insufficient slow, depending of your circumstances obviously.
New idea: collocation based approach.
And: mixing procedures.
___

Explain methods -> figures
___

Simple example: compare

data size - discuss: importance of quality of solver but time solver always> instant loss

___


Biological:
First example I want to present: Van Der Pol Osciliator (undriven)
Explain bio relevance: extended model -> model for action potentials of neurons
example: w\o noise -> figure
Discuss: if noise: 0.1 of gaussian infer structure. 
Higher noise level: pump up neural net

This was model for biological relevant system (diff eq known) we just saw we can fit to -> good. But now: actual experimental data.
Here problem: 
1. Time series data is rare and stiff often. 
2. Technical precision.
3. Underlying systems are complex.

Second example: actual biological data 
E1. experimental: something easy ######## TODO ########
Explain briefly experiment and show fit. 


E2. experimental and stiff: sarahs 
Explain briefly experiment. Show fit.
Explain idea of multiple shooting: ######## TODO ########


____


Ok and now:  we have the a fitted neural ODE. so what?
idea would be now to use the inferred gradient field back to the theory about the structure of the underlying system

If you remember form beginning:
I actually would like something like a "real" ODE
e.g. have parameter alpha that relates to production rate of protein x.

This is the bigger picture of my phd research:
mechanistic modeling + data driven we we cannot do mechanistic to retrieve info of underlying system
-> figure

Thanks. Happy to take any questions.
